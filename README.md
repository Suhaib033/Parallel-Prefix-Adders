# Parallel-Prefix-Adders

The Adder Circuit is undoubtedly the most important component in the entire VLSI Domain. Adder does subtraction (via 2's complement arithmetic) and is the core part of multiplier circuits. As addition is the most basic arithmetic operation, adder's become the  most fundamental arithmetic component of the processor.

This project discusses  a  chosen  few  traditional approaches to addition, analyses their performance and then evaluates and compares the performance of several Parallel prefix adders.

The adders are implemented in Verilog  Hardware  Description  Language  using  Vivado  Design  Suite  wherein  the  designs  are implemented  on  Xilinx  ZYNQ  XC7Z020  (7000  series)  SoC.
